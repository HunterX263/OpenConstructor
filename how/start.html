				openconstructor has two main modes, selected using the button just to the right of the file menu. choose "simulate" to animate and play with a model or "construct" to stop the animation so that you may add new masses and springs. from the same button you can also select "delete" to remove individual masses and springs
			</p>
			<p class="indent2">
				<img src="../img/b10_09F.gif">
				you can use your right mouse buttton to cycle through the options in reverse order as well

				models are currently stored as part of a url to the website
			</p>
			<p class="indent2">
				<img src="../img/b10_09F.gif">
				if you paste a url someone has provided to you into your browser, the model will be loaded automatically
			</p>
			<p class="indent2">
				<img src="../img/b10_09F.gif">
				warning: the loaded model will replace the model you are currently playing with, if you make a model you like don't load a model until you have saved your own (or open the model in a new tab)

			</p>
			<p class="indent3">
				<img src="../img/b10_09F.gif">
				openconstructor models are made out of masses linked by springs and muscles. you can grab the masses with your mouse and drag them around the screen
			</p>
			<p class="indent3">
				<img src="../img/b10_09F.gif">
				do be gentle! some of the models are fragile and don't like being treated rough

				change the world
			</p>
			<p class="indent3">
				<img src="../img/b10_09F.gif">
				gravity: turn it up high and models are squashed by their own weight, turn it down low and things float. you can even turn gravity upside down using the popup menu
			</p>
			<p class="indent3">
				<img src="../img/b10_09F.gif">
				friction: friction slows moving masses. apply lots of friction and it's like moving in treacle, low friction and things can move fast but might wobble out of control
			</p>
			<p class="indent3">
				<img src="../img/b10_09F.gif">
				spring stiffness: weak springs make models go all floppy, very stiff springs are strong, but can make the model too jittery

				muscle power
			</p>
			<p class="indent3">
				<img src="../img/b10_09F.gif">
				moving creatures are controlled by the muscle wave on the left of the screen; drag the wave sideways to increase or decrease its power
